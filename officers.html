I love to swim, paint, and laze around. I also love the beach and the ocean. I'm an out-of-state student from Arizona, so I'm really enjoying the change in scenery and weather. I joined BSSA as a Freshman because of the people I met and the collective efforts to help each other reach their aspirations. It is my honor to serve as a Co-President of BSSA this year and I hope that I can continue to make BSSA a vibrant and welcoming organization. If you need anything, please do not hesitate to contact me, I am happy to help! I highly encourage you to join BSSA and join one of the many committees!</p>

I hope to become a neurosurgeon someday and be able to travel and help people around the world, especially my hometown, the Philippines. I love outdoor adventures, sports, photography, and music! I recently got a very loving and energetic Alaskan Husky, named "Murphy". Come to our events and you might get to meet "Murphy"!

I am a third year Revelle student who aspires to become a STEM professor. I remember first stepping foot onto this campus in search of the place I belong. Through the support of my committees and all of the unforgettable experiences, BSSA has helped me find my direction and a trustworthy group of friends. This organization has not only taught me what is necessary for obtaining my dream career; BSSA’s culture of mentorship and unity has fueled the discovery of my passions and reinvigorated my constant curiosity. I urge you to learn and grow with the rest of the BSSA family here at UCSD.</p>

I hail from the Bay Area, which means that my parents constantly hear about La Jolla’s (usually) superb weather. I love photography and videography, drawing, hiking, and any and all animals. I also play the violin as a part of The Intermission Orchestra at UCSD — Studio Ghibli pieces are definitely my favorite. As logistics coordinator, I will be managing the website and keeping track of attendance. Feel free to contact me about any suggestions and questions for the website, attendance points, and BSSA in general. </p>

                                    <p class="bio">Hey everybody! I’m Brittney and I am a molecular biology major from Revelle. I enjoy spending time with friends and family, listening to music (open to hear any new suggestions), eating out, or just being outside in general. I hope to get back into playing the piano and violin, a possible how to play the guitar better. Oh, I’m  also a sucker for puns! I was very involved in high school with a club that they became like my second family and coming into college I wanted to still have a group like that. After going to the first GBM, I could see how close all the members were and how they have an enjoyable time together. My goal as your co-first year programs chair is to help make your your collage experience a little more enjoyable with new people. I hope we first year programs co-chair that I help provide the right resource for you and make your college experience memorable.</p>

My goal is to conduct research in environmental biology and hopefully get some opportunities to travel for work--exploring new habitats and countries. I joined BSSA last year and am so thankful for all the opportunities, resources, and people this org has exposed me to. I hope that everyone has an equally amazing experience with BSSA when they join and to ease the transition for all you freshmen and transfer students as First Year Programs Co-Chair. In my free time I enjoy spending time with friends, trying new food, searching for the best boba in SD, going to the beach, and hiking. Definitely hit me up if you are looking for an adventure buddy! And please feel free to ask me any questions you may have about BSSA, UCSD, or anything else and I would be happy to help you out--and maybe it can even become a BSSA event! Hope to see you around and be sure to check out First Year Programs Committee!</p>

I love to play any and all sports, board games, card games, or video games (especially Fortnite so add me). I also work in an Autism research lab, and I volunteer at a hospital in Escondido. I've always been passionate about community service and giving back to the community that has helped shape me into who I am. I joined BSSA after transferring to UCSD last year, and I found that our slogan "Educate. Enrich. Empower." is very accurate. Information when you need it, research and volunteer opportunities, and a welcoming group dynamic all made BSSA a perfect fit for me. This year, with the help of my co-chair Megan and our committee, I would like to see an increase of fun, relevant, and educational volunteer opportunities. I hope to see you all at our volunteer events! </p>

I am a second-year Human Biology major in Eleanor Roosevelt College. My goals lie within health care, where I plan to work toward being a surgeon. What type, you ask? Neurosurgeon, though I'm keep my options open. My interests include, but are not limited to history, literature, animation, the growth of video games as art, the science of historical and practical swordsmanship, and comedy. While working on the volunteer committee and going to other events during my freshman year, I've seen that BSSA endeavors to provide a social circle that both alleviates the stresses of being a biology student and affords a lot of opportunities to gain skills and connections that can help improve the personal or professional side of any member's life, and as a co-chair for the publicity committee this year, I'm happy to bring all those opportunities to your metaphorical doorstep. Not your literal doorstep though, that'd be kind of difficult, not to mention awkward. I did deliver cookies once for BSSA though. It was pretty fun. Cookies were nice too, I bought some for myself. Gee, I'm kinda hungry now, so yeah, lesson of the day is to go to BSSA events, because there might be cookies.</p>

I also love talking about films and television, but I mostly like watching them.

                                        <p class="bio">Hello everyone! I am Jezra Relente, and I am this year's Annual Events Co-Chair together with Nikhil. You'll find me a lot on my longboard across campus (it helps me clear my mind after a good study grind) or chilling at the Village game room. It's not often that you get to pursue your passion and find a group that can support your journey - and I'm glad I found mine in BSSA. As a biology transfer, it was overwhelming trying to navigate my way through UCSD, but becoming a part of the BSSA family has helped me gain a sense of direction and insight about my potential career path. By being constantly exposed to experiences that put me out of my comfort zone, I have been able to find my voice and a community that echoes my passion for science. UCSD is a big world in and of itself and I look forward to working with you in helping you find your path through BSSA!</p>

                                    <p class="bio">Hi everyone! My name is Nikhil and I am one of the Co-Chairs for the Annual Events Committee! I joined BSSA because I wanted to get more involved, further pursue my passion for science, and to make new friends. One regret I have is not joining BSSA my freshman year. I would definitely recommend getting involved with BSSA as soon as possible! This club really has a family-like vibe that is hard to find elsewhere and provides many useful opportunities to network, learn and grow. Get involved in subcommittees! Especially Annual Events ;)</p>

It is my second year returning to Social Activities, and I am looking forward to meeting all of you and enriching *or beginning* your socially thriving life at UCSD!  Some interests we may share include: museums, badminton, Boba Guys, new music, and late night adventures (I'm originally from the Bay!).  Putting our personal interests and BSSA passion together, I hope BSSA socials help you open up to exploring the unique, ranging opportunities that BSSA offers.  And I hope to get to know you! ..Mention this bio at an event for free boba!</p>

In my free time I love to travel and wish to have a career in the future where I'm able to bring healthcare to countries around the world. I'm super excited for everything in store this year, social committee and BSSA as a whole. My goal is to create a community within BSSA where everyone feels welcome and comfortable with one another through socials such as beach bonfires, game nights and food runs! Hope to see you there!</p>
