                                <p>The BSSA Mentor-Mentee Program is aimed towards, but not limited to, freshmen and transfer students at UC San Diego. This program pairs new, incoming UCSD students with experienced upperclassmen who share similar career aspirations, majors, hobbies, and general areas of interest. In doing so, BSSA acts as a liaison in promoting the development of positive mentor-mentee relationships that boost the personal growth of both mentors and mentees. We hope this relationship between mentor and mentee will facilitate a smoother with academic advice, extracurriculars, and more.</p>
                                <p>We encourage all those who may be interested in participating in this enriching experience to apply for the academic year! All you need to do is fill out a brief <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/W6YIZrmuDyTGkmds1">Google Form</a>.</p>

Mentors are expected to provide mentees with a vast array of resources to help ease transition into UCSD, BSSA, and promote academic success such as:</li>

It is still encouraged that mentors and mentees continue to reach out in the future if they would like to continue. Mentors and mentees can put in as much time into the program — meeting up and remaining in contact — as they wish; however, for active mentorship, there are guidelines to be completed. BSSA events are usually one to three hours. Independently organized meetups outside of BSSA events are expected to be about an hour to best benefit both parties.</p>
